       <p>
        I am an aspiring software developer on track to start my internship on March 2023. I have technical skills in HTML, 
        CSS, Javascript, Python, Java, C++, and React.js. I have also gained valuable soft skills
        from working as a server at a restaurant for several years.
      </p>
       <p>
          I finished an eight months coding Bootcamp by the organization Thinkful. It was a fast-paced program focused 
          on full-stack web development. While I learned a tremendous amount of knowledge, I wanted to solidify my foundations
          before I started any job. This led me to Year Up, a skill development program that aims to train young individuals to
          be professionals in the tech world. 
       </p>
       <p> 
          I hope to work as a software developer in a company that aims to make a positive change. Once I am financially stable, 
          I would love to teach the valuable lesson I've learned professionally and personally to the up-and-coming youths of the world. 
        </p>
       <p>
          Something to know about me is that when I get passionate about something, I dive deep into that passion. Whether it be photography,
           music, movies, or programming, I take the time and effort to appreciate my endeavors in-depth. I hope to continue my ever-expanding 
           array of hobbies and interests. 
        </p>
